## :loudspeaker: About
The objective of the workshop is to showcase how users can make their ideas fun through art, stories, and templates using AI. 
<!-- You can look at other TAP projects if you need a better idea of how to describe your workshops objectives -->

This interactive workshop allows participants to explore the combination of creativity, AI, and programming through art. Using tools like Processing, Java, and DALL-E, participants create personalized images based on their input and then color and design them on an interactive canvas.

## :page_with_curl: Project Description
In this project, participants will explore the intersection of creativity, AI, and programming by creating interactive art. They’ll start by generating an image from a text prompt using DALL-E AI, then use an interactive canvas to color and design their artwork. While doing this, they’ll learn basic programming concepts through Java, gaining insight into how AI and coding work together behind the scenes

* [Processing](https://processing.org/) Processing uses Java’s programming language and is used for making visuals and interactive graphics .


DALL-E (AI)(https://openai.com/index/dall-e/)
  <img alt="Dall-e Logo" src = "https://i.pinimg.com/736x/7e/ee/2f/7eee2fc41654561afbe2ded749b06b29.jpg" width="200" height="200"/>
An AI model that generates images from textual descriptions. It will be used to create art templates based on participant-provided prompts.

Why we chose Processing: It is easy to use and helps participants create interactive and visual art while learning programming concepts. This makes it ideal for engaging participants in both art and coding.

Why we chose DALL-E: It allows for fast and creative image generation based on participant prompts, making the process fun, interactive, and highly engaging.
